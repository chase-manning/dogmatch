# Sorted

- After doing the first Visual round, the page went blank > then when I refreshed, it went back to “Start a new quiz” (no option to pick back up the old quiz). When I clicked Back, the page was also still blank.
- Clicking next on the breed page photo shows a white screen
- Lien: review all the copy
- Check the tournement logic, seems like the dog order is wrong
- Make open source
- 'Back: Behavioral' and 'Next: Visual' didn't make sense
- Two people were sick of the visual quiz at 93%
- Mobile: Make the sub-heading slightly narrower (i.e. further away from the edge of the screen on both sides)
- Mobile: “Most popular dogs this week” > change so it just shows the dog card + you can flick across to see the most popular dogs one at a time Add the little circles underneath so you can see how many there are. Remove the main dog
- Mobile: Dog page: About: Make font size smaller
- Mobile: Dog page: You may also like: Some of the dog names are a bit too long + overhang the photo > anything we can do about this?
- Mobile: Dog Page: Dog name: Delete pawprint before the dog name, Centre-align the name
- Mobile: dog page: Delete drop shadow from all boxes, Split up the boxes more (see Figma)
- Mobile: Dog page: Key stats: Height + Weight should either be next to each other or one below the other (as they should logically be grouped together), Emojis should be in line with the Stat heading only (i.e. Group, Height etc) - not in the middle of both lines of text (see Figma), Coloured ratings should be closer together (looks a bit too spaced out currently), Tooltips appear half off the screen so you can’t read them
- Mobile: Dog page: Behaviour: Coloured ratings should be closer together (looks a bit too spaced out currently)
- Mobile: Dog page: Care reqs: Emojis should be in line with the Stat heading only (i.e. Coat style etc) - not in the middle of both lines of text (see Figma), Coloured ratings should be closer together (looks a bit too spaced out currently)
- Mobile: Calculating your perfect match: Make the font smaller, Pawprints appear over the top toolbar, Make pawprints smaller
- Mobile: “How important is this to you” should be normal text, not bold
- Mobile: Which dog is your perfect match? > pawprints are too close to the top
- Mobile Footer: First line looks funny, maybe not aligned due to the emoji? Make font size smaller
- Change the quiz questions numbers to be continuous (not per section)
- Add an indication of how short or long the lifespan is (in actual years in the min max)
- It should be more clear that you can choose multiple of the multi choise (pick as many as you like)
- Desktop: Dog Card: Increase size of rating labels (and on mobile)
- Clicking a dog card before it loads navigates to 404 page
- Mobile: Delete the smallest pawprint + adjust the rest to be centred
- Popularity isn't clear. Should stress the ease of getting it

- The main image flickers when you change breeds on the breed page
